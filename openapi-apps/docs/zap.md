OWASP ZAP requires authentication to interact with its API securely. The default authentication method is API Key authentication.

## Obtaining the API Key
1. **Start OWASP ZAP** on your machine.
2. Go to `Tools` → `Options`.
3. Navigate to the `API` tab.
4. Locate the **API Key** field and copy the key.
   - If no key is displayed, enable API key enforcement and generate a new one.

## Security Considerations
- Never expose the API key in public repositories.
- Restrict API access using ZAP’s API settings.
- Consider using IP whitelisting to limit access to the API.
