This guide explains how to authenticate with the [Logit.io](https://logit.io/) API using the appropriate authentication methods.

## Base URL
All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.logit.io
```

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication
You can authenticate by appending an API key as a query parameter.

**Example Request:**
```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.logit.io/your-endpoint?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY"
```
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key, which you can find in your Logit.io account settings.

## Testing Authentication
To verify that authentication is successful, you can call a test endpoint:
```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.logit.io/v1/status" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS"
```
If authentication is successful, the response will contain API status details.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that your API key or credentials are correct.
- Check that your account has the necessary permissions.
- If using Basic Authentication, verify that credentials are correctly encoded.
