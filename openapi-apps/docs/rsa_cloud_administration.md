4. Fill in the key parameter in the script below with the contents of the .key file generated in the above step.
```
{% python %}
import jwt
def generate_token():
    key = {"customerName":"","accessID":"","description":"","accessKey":"","adminRestApiUrl":""}
    exp = time.time() + 60 * 60 
    jwt_claims = {
        "iat": time.time(), # Set issued at time to the current time.
        "exp": exp, # Set expiration time
        "aud": key["adminRestApiUrl"],  # Audience of the claim.
        "sub": key["accessID"], # Access ID from the Admin API Key.
    }

    # Use the accessKey from the Admin API key file and the RS256 algorithm to generate the JWT
    return jwt.encode(jwt_claims, key["accessKey"], algorithm="RS256")
    
print(generate_token())
{% endpython %}
```
4. Then provide the above python script as your api key when authenticating the app in Soar.

5. Remember to provide your URL as well
