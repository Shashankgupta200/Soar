### How to Create a Slack App
1. Create a Slack account.
2. Go to the [Create Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) page.
3. Follow the [Slack App Creation Guide](https://api.slack.com/start/overview#creating).
4. Once the app is created, assign the required roles and permissions using this guide: [Sending Messages with Slack API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending).
5. Obtain the API key:
   - Navigate to "OAuth & Permissions" from your Slack App homepage.
   - Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-your-token`).

2. Open "Channel Details."
3. Click on the three dots icon for more options.

## Posting Messages via Soar

### Getting Slack Channel ID
To post a message, you need the `channel_id`. There are two ways to obtain it:

1. **From Slack Web Interface**:
   - Open Slack in a web browser.
   - Navigate to the desired channel.
   - The URL will be in the format: `https://app.slack.com/client/XXXXXXXXXX/channel_id`.
   - The last part of the URL is your `channel_id`.

2. **Using Slack API (`conversations.list`)**:
   - Use the [Get Channel List](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) API method.
   - This method retrieves all channel IDs programmatically.

### Posting a Message
1. Select the **"Post Message"** action in the Soar app.
2. Create an **Authentication entry** using the API Key obtained earlier.
3. Provide the following parameters:
   - **`channel_id`** (ID of the channel where the message should be posted)
   - **`message`** (Text content of the message)
4. Execute the action, and the message will be sent to Slack.

### Example API Request
```bash
curl -X POST "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer xoxb-your-token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "channel": "C01234567",
    "text": "Hello, this is a test message from Soar!"
}'
```

## Important Notes
- **Permissions**: Ensure your Slack app has the correct permissions (`chat:write` for posting messages, `channels:read` for retrieving channel info).
- **Use Slack's API for Best Accuracy**: The URL method for retrieving `channel_id` may not always be reliable. The API method is preferred.
