# TheHive
The TheHive app for Soar allows users to interact with TheHive's API, enabling functionalities such as case management, alerts, observables, and more. Authentication is required via API Key and Instance URL to use TheHive.

## Authentication
This app requires authentication using an API Key and an Instance URL.

1. **Go to TheHive API Key Management:**

   - Log in with your administrator credentials.

2. **Create an API Key:**
   - Go to your user profile settings.
   - Under **API Keys**, click **Create a new API Key**.
   - Copy the API Key immediately, as it won't be displayed again.

3. **Find Your TheHive Instance URL:**
   - The Instance URL is the base URL of your TheHive server (e.g., `http://your-instance`).

4. **Add the API Key and URL to Soar:**
